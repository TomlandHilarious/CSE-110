## Me As a Programmer
I am an undergraduate student with a major in *cognitive science with a specialization with machine learning and neural network* and a minor in *computer science* at the __University of California, San Diego__. I have experience as a tutor in both data science and computer science. My primary coding language is __Python__, and I am familiar with writing code in __Java, C++,__ and __C__. I believe that the purpose of programing or building any technologies is to address the needs of people, so it is important to identify the needs of different groups. My area of interest focuses on analyzing data and using the data to create opportunities and better outcomes for people who are the source of data.
